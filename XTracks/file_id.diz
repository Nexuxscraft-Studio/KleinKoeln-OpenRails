XTracks v3.20 standard edition setup (xtrack, x-track, x-tracks)
Automatic installer for end users. Those wanting to get their 
hands dirty should get the files only instead ('xtracksf.zip').
Includes build #38 of the standardized tsection.dat.
This is all that is needed if you don't build routes 
(route builders get the 'extras' package also).
Works for any route requiring version 2.0, 3.0 or later.
